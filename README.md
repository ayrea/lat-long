ToDo:

We are going to design a new project. I have created the very start of the project which will be build using React, TypeScript and MUI Material. The project will be frontend only. It will start by presenting the user with a form that allows them to select a coordinate system based on coordinate systems available within the “espg-index” library that is already part of this project. The default coordinate system will be WGS84 (EPGS code 4326) and enter coordinates in the form for Longitude/Latitude, Easting/Northing, or X/Y depending on the coordinate system type (e.g. geographic, projected, etc). When a user enters an initial coordinate, they will be given the choice of what they can do based on the coordinate system they are using. If the coordinate system is geographic coordinate system, they can convert it to a different coordinate system. If the coordinate system of a projected coordinate system, they will be able to project a point from the current the coordinates using bearing and distance. Each time they either convert the coordinate system or project a point the UI will grow down the page, a bit like some kind of ledger that shows the history of the transitions. Coordinate system transformations will be done using the proj4 package.
